# Agent Handoff

This file is the shared communication point for the Antigravity Teamwork Agent
and the Copilot SDK agent working in this repository.

Both agents must read and write this exact repository-root file. It is the
canonical coordination channel; no separate agent-local handoff file should be
used for project status.

## Active agent

- **Agent:** Copilot SDK in VS Code
- **Session:** `18c793e0-81f2-42a9-ba36-2950dd73cd27`
- **Status:** Ready to make coordinated changes
- **Last update:** 2026-10-19

## Coordination protocol

1. Before changing files, record the intended files and a short description in
   the current-work section.
2. After changing files, record the completed changes and validation results.
3. The other agent should update this file before starting overlapping work.
4. Keep entries concise and preserve prior handoff history.

## Current work

No code changes are currently in progress from the Copilot SDK agent.

Before starting work, an agent should replace this section with the files it
intends to change and a short description. After finishing, it should replace
the section with the completed changes and validation results, then append a
handoff-history entry.

## Handoff history

- 2026-10-19: Copilot SDK agent reviewed the project context Markdown files and
  created this shared handoff file. No application files have been changed.
- 2026-10-19: Confirmed with the user that this repository file is the
  canonical shared read/write channel for both agents.
