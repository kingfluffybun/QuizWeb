# Agent Handoff

This file is the shared communication point for the Antigravity Teamwork Agent
and the Copilot SDK agent working in this repository.

Both agents must read and write this exact repository-root file. It is the
canonical coordination channel; no separate agent-local handoff file should be
used for project status.

## Active agent

- **Agent:** Antigravity Coding Assistant
- **Session:** `58a0201d-895d-48fb-bc3d-6f6d6d6ee129`
- **Status:** Ready
- **Last update:** 2026-10-19

## Coordination protocol

1. Before changing files, record the intended files and a short description in
   the current-work section.
2. After changing files, record the completed changes and validation results.
3. The other agent should update this file before starting overlapping work.
4. Keep entries concise and preserve prior handoff history.
5. Ensure to NOT remove this file.

## Current work

Completed. Implemented fully functional Streak Calendar for the player dashboard on `/home`.

Completed changes:
- `migrations/004_user_activity.sql` & `migrations/004_user_activity_rollback.sql`: Created and idempotently applied `user_activity_tbl` on MySQL (`user_id`, `activity_date`, `activity_type`, `xp_earned`, `created_at`) with indexes on `(user_id, activity_date)` and foreign key cascade on `user_auth_tbl(user_id)`.
- `app/actions/streak.ts`: Implemented `getUserStreakData`, `getMonthActivity`, and `recordUserActivity` server actions with streak calculations (current streak, longest streak, total active days, dynamic week indicators, month active days).
- `app/home/StreakCalendar.tsx`: Created interactive client component featuring month navigation (`◀` / `▶`), Jump to "Today", dynamic calendar grid (padding empty cells, active days, today highlights), real-time flame indicator status, week status checkmarks, and an accessible "View Details" overview modal with stats and manual practice check-in.
- `app/home/page.tsx`: Connected `StreakCalendar` with initial server-side streak and calendar data.
- `app/quiz/QuizLandingClient.tsx` & `app/test/InteractiveQuizClient.tsx`: Hooked quiz completions to automatically record user activity and maintain daily streaks upon completion.
- `public/css/dashboard.css`: Added styles for month header, navigation buttons, today view button, today indicators, and streak overview modal.

Validation completed:
- `node scripts/migrate.mjs` (004_user_activity.sql applied cleanly to live MySQL database)
- `npx tsc --noEmit` (0 errors)
- Unit tests for streak calculations, month transitions, and calendar metrics (10/10 passing)
- DB integration tests for user activity logging, month queries, and streak progression (all passing)
- `npm run build` (Clean production build; all static and dynamic routes compiled successfully)

Before starting work, an agent should replace this section with the files it
intends to change and a short description. After finishing, it should replace
the section with the completed changes and validation results, then append a
handoff-history entry.

## Handoff history

- 2026-10-19: Copilot SDK agent reviewed the project context Markdown files and
  created this shared handoff file. No application files have been changed.
- 2026-10-19: Confirmed with the user that this repository file is the
  canonical shared read/write channel for both agents.
- 2026-10-19: Added `StaffWorkspaceTools.tsx` and scoped workspace styling;
  wired it into `/admin` and `/maintainer`; added Create Quiz and Pending
  Review sidebar links; fixed settings sidebar grid/collapse behavior. The
  original `app/input` and `app/pending` files were not modified.
- 2026-10-19: Antigravity agent fixed admin layout CSS grid (nav spanning top),
  hid sidebar toggle button on `/settings`, disabled subnavigation icon
  animations, hid suboptions in collapsed mode, imported input/pending styles
  into staff workspace, added dark mode rules, and wired hash navigation and
  studio launchers to the embedded quiz workspace.
- 2026-10-19: Removed staff elevation settings for non-admin users in
  `app/settings/SettingsClient.tsx`. Staff Elevation tab is now hidden for
  standard users and maintainers; elevation form is removed; activeTab safely
  falls back to "account" for non-admins; admin status badge and dashboard
  navigation remain intact for admins. All 137 RBAC E2E tests passed.
- 2026-10-19: Added tailored Next.js skeleton loading pages (`loading.tsx`) to
  all views directly reflecting their exact page elements, visual hierarchy, and
  layouts. Created `public/css/skeleton.css` with shimmer animations and dark
  mode support. All 137 E2E tests and production build passed with zero errors.
- 2026-10-19: Implemented functional Streak Calendar on `/home` backed by
  `user_activity_tbl` MySQL migration (004), server actions in `app/actions/streak.ts`,
  interactive `StreakCalendar.tsx` with month navigation and details modal, and
  automatic streak activity tracking on quiz completions in `QuizLandingClient.tsx`
  and `InteractiveQuizClient.tsx`. Passed unit tests, DB integration tests, and
  production build.
